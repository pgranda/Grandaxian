## Brief:   
Galaxian is based on ‘Space Invaders’ concept with a few additional gameplay elements.	
For instance the game was in colour – sprites, explosions, fonts, scrolling starfield – the UI was using the whole RGB palette.	
Enemies descending onto the player’s spaceship had different patterns of movement, including “kamikaze” style dives, making the game unpredictable and thus more interesting. The gameplay was based on aliens attacking in swarms, with the player’s ship movement restricted to horizontal left/right direction with only one shot on the screen at a time.
